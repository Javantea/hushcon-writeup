 the Grand Cayman Turtle Farm! Sea turtle meat cannot be legally sold in
 the U.S. thanks to those liberal treehuggers in Congress and their 
precious "Endangered Species Act," so he's set up a market on the 
darkweb to sell the sea turtle meat. Personally I'm all like "fuck it, 
I'll throw down on some turtle soup", but PETA is picketing in front of 
Hushcon Crimenet HQ, so you gumshoes are going to have to bring him 
down.</p><p>Vic's darkweb market is located at 
http://qe4zohjnmtu4pn2a.onion/, and we know from public data breaches 
that he frequently uses the password "lolturtles". If you can 
de-anonymize the server hosting his market, you may be able to login 
with the same password.</p></td>

 it's up to YOU to recover all of the stolen letters and restore the 
Hangul alphabet to the Korean people! Intelligence tells us that she's 
been emailing the sweatshop that's manufacturing her fashion accesories

in a country in Central America that reaches the shores of both the 
Pacific Ocean and the Carribean Sea, and is known for its coffee and

and won't stop blowing up the Chief's phone. Lucky for us, Kneemoi's 
having difficulties communicating with her ship, so she's stranded on 
Earth for the moment. But Carmen has set up a server on her laptop to 
relay her transmissions through a satellite in Earth's high orbit to 
help boost the signal. Gumshoes: Break into the server, intercept 
Kneemoi's communications, and prevent her from returning home with 
Aldrin's footprints!</p><p>We hear that Carmen is on an island in French
 Polynesia. Known for its stunning turquoise lagoon, it is often 
referred to as the most beautiful island in the world. She's running the
 service locally (<strong>Hint:</strong> Server format is <em>country_name</em>.baybedoll.com),
 and we were able to determine that she uploaded the source code for the
 echo server to pastebin: https://pastebin.com/raw/aDfW5cAq</p></td>
